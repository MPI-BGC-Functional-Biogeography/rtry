# The TRY database

The TRY database (https://www.try-db.org) is a Plant Trait Database operated since 2007 with the aim to improve the availability and accessibility of plant trait data for ecology and earth system sciences. Since then, the TRY database has grown continuously and is now providing unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy for research community worldwide.

In 2014, the TRY database was made publicly available through the implementation of the TRY Data Portal (https://www.try-db.org/TryWeb/dp.php; Kattge et al. 2020). This Portal organizes data uploads, searches and requests, and enables interaction between data contributors, management and users. (For details related data request, please refer to the 'Request data from the TRY database' section below.)

The TRY database version 5 released on 26 March 2019, contained 387 data sets providing 11.8 million trait records, for 2091 traits and 280000 plant taxa, mostly at the species level.  The trait data are accompanied by 35 million ancillary data of about 3000 different types to provide information about plant growth conditions, plant state at the time of sampling, and measurement protocols (context information) (Kattge et al. 2011, 2020). 


The TRY database is:

- an integrated database for all kinds of plant traits,
- trait data and all additional attributes relevant to understand and interpret a given trait value (Kattge 2011a),
- frequently used (about 5000 data requests per year),
- key features (Kattge 2011b, 2020),
- generic data structure (Kattge 2011a),
- data processing at import

## Column headers

Through the TRY Data Portal, the trait data is provided as zipped text file (`.txt`) with `Latin-1` encoding. In version 5, there are 27 tab-delimited columns in the provided data, which is indicated as header in the first row of the text file.

# The TRY R Project

Due to the unique long table structure, the TRY data must be preprocessed in a way such that it is easy to handle and understand before analysis. The `rtry` package for `R` provides a set of functions to facilitate the preprocessing of the TRY data, that allows users who are not familiar with the `R` programming language or the TRY dataset structure to easily prepare the data for further analysis.

This project is an open-source project that can be found on the MPI-BGC-Functional-Biogeography GitHub repository: https://github.com/MPI-BGC-Functional-Biogeography/rtry

Users can also choose to obtain the source package and relative documentation, as well as the sample data and example workflows from the Nextcloud operated by MPI-BGC.

- Link: https://nextcloud.bgc-jena.mpg.de/s/RMd5kqg7tRWXpae
- Password: `mpi-bgc-rtry`

<br>

## R environment

R 4.0.3 was used to develop and build the `rtry` package, and this is the minimum version required to use the package. It is also recommended to use the latest version of RStudio when using the package.

The latest version of R can be downloaded from CRAN, a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store the code and documentation of R: https://cran.r-project.org/

The released version of RStudio, an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for productive R programming, can be found at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/, it is sufficient to use the free and open source version of RStudio Desktop.

<br>

## Installation guide

The installation of the `rtry` package can be performed through the RStudio console.

First, install all the dependencies with the command.

```R
install.packages(c("data.table", "dplyr", "tidyr", "jsonlite", "curl"))
```

Once installation is completed, the message `The downloaded source packages are in <path>` should be seen.

Next, install the `rtry` package with the command:

```R
install.packages("<path_to_rtry.tar.gz>", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

Note: The character `\` is used as escape character in R to give the following character special meaning (e.g. `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab, `\r` for carriage return and so on). Therefore, for Windows users, it is important to replace the `\` in the file path with `/` in order for R to correctly understand the input path.

You may ignore the warning message `Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed` if appears.

Once the installation is completed, the `rtry` package can be loaded with the command:

```R
library(rtry)
```

# The `rtry` package

`rtry` is an R package to support the application of plant trait data received via the TRY database. For this purpose, `rtry` provides easy applicable functions for the basic steps of data preprocessing, e.g. data import, data exploration, selection of columns and rows, filtering trait data according to different attributes, geocoding, long- to wide-table transformation, and data export. `rtry` was initially developed as part of the TRY R project to preprocess trait data received via the TRY database.

Key for data analyses: filtering â€“ however, depending on filtering aspects, relevant information for filtering is at different places: trait, species, trait data name, values of auxiliary data, units, identifiers for duplicates and outliers

The `rtry` package is supposed to be applicable without advanced knowledge of the TRY database or the R software. Inside the package, we use a function naming convention where each function begins with the prefix `rtry_` followed by what the specific function does.

- `rtry_import`
- `rtry_explore`
- `rtry_bind_col`
- `rtry_bind_row`
- `rtry_merge_col`
- `rtry_merge_row`
- `rtry_select_col`
- `rtry_select_row`
- `rtry_select_aux`
- `rtry_filter`
- `rtry_filter_keyword`
- `rtry_rm_col`
- `rtry_rm_dup`
- `rtry_trans_wider`
- `rtry_export`
- `rtry_geocoding`
- `rtry_revgeocoding`

Detailed description of each function can be found in the reference manual (`.pdf`) generated by CRAN, or via the command:

```R
# Obtain a list of documentation for the package
# including both the vignettes and function documentation
?? rtry

# For the documentation of a specific function (e.g. `rtry_import())
# type a `?` in front of the function name
?rtry_import
```

<br>

## Example workflows using `rtry`

To assist first-time user, several example workflows have been developed and are provided in different formats:

- vignettes, that comes along with the `rtry` package without additional download, acts as a guideline for users to follow
- R Markdown scripts (`.Rmd`) and HTML files (`.html`), located inside the `examples` directory can be downloaded from the MPI-BGC Nextcloud, allows users to run the example scripts (`.Rmd`) directly and compare the expected results (`.html`) in the browser

The sample data required to try out the example workflow are not only provided withinthe `rtry` package, but also inside the `examples/input` directory on the MPI-BGC Nextcloud mentioned in the beginning of the previous section. In order to follow the workflow smoothly, make sure the script is place inside a folder in which the sample data is saved inside the `input` folder. This can be done manually or achieved simply by downloading the entire `examples` directory from the Nextcloud.

<br>

The list of example workflows:

- [The general workflow](rtry-workflow-general.html)
  - An example workflow setup to demonstrate how to use the `rtry` package to preprocess of the data exported from the TRY database
  - Covers most of the `rtry_` functions from importing and exploring to binding multiple data, as well as selecting, filtering specific data and removing duplicates, and finally exporting the preprocess data


- [Perform (reverse) geocoding](rtry-workflow-geocoding.html)
  - An example workflow setup to demonstrate how to use the `rtry` package to perform geocoding and reverse geocoding on the TRY data
  - Covers mainly the `rtry_geocoding()` and `rtry_revgeocoding()` functions
