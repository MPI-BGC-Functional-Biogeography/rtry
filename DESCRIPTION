Description: A package to support the application of plant trait data providing easy applicable functions 
    for the basic steps of data preprocessing, e.g. data import, data exploration, selection of columns 
    and rows, filtering trait data according to different attributes, geocoding, long- to wide-table 
    transformation, and data export. rtry was initially developed as part of the TRY R project to 
    preprocess trait data received via the TRY database.
